# Required. Turning debug mode on will make all commands non-global, give full error messages for all users and turn on debug logging (warning, this is spammy as hell!)
DEBUG_MODE=ON

# Optional. Lite mode will force disable all reactions FOR NEW USERS(!) and show auto-ready after hunt only. This is to reduce rate limit issues and is used by the globally available Navi Lite.
# If you want to enable this when you already have users in your database, you will have to change the columns "reactions_enabled" and "ready_after_all_commands" to 0 manually.
LITE_MODE=ON

# Optional. Additional dev user ids. These users will be able to use all /dev commands (in addition to you).
# Separate multiple ids by comma.

# Optional. Sets the bucket parameters for cooldown resets (currently sleepy potions and cookies and milk). Try lowering these if you hit global message rate limits.
# Navi checks this when a user uses one of named resets and has auto-ready active. If he uses more resets than the defined amount within the defined timespan (in minutes), auto-ready will be turned off, the user will be informed, and he will be unable to turn it on again for the same timeframe.
# Example: If you set amount 5, minutes 5 and the user uses 6 cookies and milk within 5 minutes, it will turn off auto-ready. He will not be able to turn on auto-ready again for 5 minutes.
# If paramters aren't set, default values (10 resets in 5 minutes) are used.
